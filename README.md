# GitHub Test for Aquinas

This is a test repository to explore the possibility of using GitHub as a repository for documents and scripts relating to CEDS, Ed-Fi, and related technologies.

## Benefits

* Free
* No need for additional software
* Industry standard
* Simple drag-and-drop uploads
* Tracks changes automatically
* Easily share with others
* Can host small videos

## Limitations
* 25mb size limit on files uploaded via web (would be a problem for video) 
* Not entirely intuitive for those unfamiliar with GitHub

### Possible work-arounds
* Host video files on YouTube, provide links in readme.md or in html or Word docs within pertinent folders

## Concerns
* GitHub's collaborative nature may invite questions/comments that, if answered, could be a drain on the team's time. 
   * ~~**Question**: Is it possible to turn off issue submission for non-contributors?~~
   * **Answer**: [The Issues tab can be turned off for the repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/disabling-issues)
